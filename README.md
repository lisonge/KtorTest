This is a very strange bug, and I suspect itâ€™s an issue with one of the build tools.

In `app/build.gradle.kts`, the dependency is declared as implementation but is not used in the project; however, it still causes a bug

Adding `-keep class com.hjq.toast.** {*;}` or `-keep class coil.**{*;}` or some others to `app/proguard-rules.pro` also avoids the bug
